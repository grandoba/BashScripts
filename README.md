git checkout master #make sure you are on the master branch

## Things to be careful of
### No.1: Problem with number variable assignment

```sh
i = 0 # isn't recognized
i=0 # works
```

### No.2: Problem with if clause
```sh
i = 0
if ["$i" -eq "0"]; then # isn't recognized
  echo "hello"
fi

if [ "$i" -eq "0" ]; then # works
  echo "hello"
fi
```
